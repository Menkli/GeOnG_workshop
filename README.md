# GeOnG_workshop

Thank you for enrolling to the workshop “R & geospatial data: identifying vulnerable populations at risk”.  
We will have an interactive session and I would like to ask all participants to install the latest versions of R and RStudio. Additionally, as we will work with a range of R libraries (these are “add-ons” to basic R), it would be good if everyone had them installed by the beginning of the session.
If you run into troubles or don’t find the time beforehand, don’t worry, we will look at it together during the workshop. Please find guidance below.  
## Installing R and RStudio   
1.	[Download and install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)  
2.	[Download and install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)  
Installing R enables your computer to “understand” R, while RStudio is the software we use to work with R. If you need assistance with the installation, [here is a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFGYlKvQEQ4&ab_channel=RProgramming-DDS)

## Installing R libraries
1.	Open R Studio and paste the code into the upper left or lower left panel:  
```
install.packages(c("malariaAtlas","rnaturalearth","sf","terra","raster","dplyr","remotes","RColorBrewer","tmap","knitr","rmarkdown"))  
remotes::install_github("wpgp/wpgpDownloadR")  
```

2.	Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run the first line of code, then press it again to run the second line of code. It could take a couple of minutes.  
If you have no experience with R and RStudio at all, you might want to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY8BISK5DpM&ab_channel=RProgramming101) (or really any of the plentiful R beginner tutorials on youtube)

**[Worldpop](https://www.worldpop.org/)**  
An understanding of the numbers, characteristics and locations of human populations underpins operational work, policy analyises and scientific development globally across multiple sectors. However, traditional population data sources are often outdated, have low granularity and are updated on the scale of decades. New data sources and recent methodological advances made by the WorldPop program now provide high resolution, open and contemporary data on human population distributions, allowing accurate measurement of local population distributions, compositions, characteristics, growth and dynamics, across national and regional scales.

**[Malaria Atlas Project](https://malariaatlas.org/)**  
The Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) is a network of researchers (from public health to mathematics, geography, and epidemiology). MAP assembles global databases on malaria risk and intervention coverage and develops innovative analysis methods that use those data to address critical questions. These include better understanding the global landscape of malaria risk, how this is changing, and the impact of malaria interventions. By evaluating burden, trends, and impact at fine geographical scale we support informed decision making for malaria control at international, regional and national scales.

As part of this mission, MAP obtains, curates, and shares a wide variety of malariometric data. These include malaria cases reported by surveillance systems, nationally representative cross-sectional surveys of parasite rate, and satellite imagery capturing global environmental conditions that influence malaria transmission. The MAP group provides the outputs of our research, as well as broader technical advice and support, to National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs), non-governmental organisations (NGOs), Ministries of Health, and other third parties as part of our commitment to open access data.

MAP is aa World Health Organization Collaborating Centre in Geospatial Disease Modelling, led by Professor Peter Gething at Telethon Kids Institute at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia.

MAP collaborates with WHO on the estimation of malaria programme coverage and disease burden and projecting changes in malaria risk to 2040.

**[CHIRPS - Rainfall Estimates from Rain Gauge and Satellite Observations](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps)**   
Since 1999, USGS and CHC scientists have developed techniques for producing rainfall maps.

Estimating rainfall variations in space and time is a key aspect of drought early warning and environmental monitoring. An evolving drier-than-normal season must be placed in a historical context so that the severity of rainfall deficits can be quickly evaluated. However, estimates derived from satellite data provide areal averages that suffer from biases due to complex terrain, which often underestimate the intensity of extreme precipitation events. Conversely, precipitation grids produced from station data suffer in more rural regions where there are less rain-gauge stations. CHIRPS was created in collaboration with scientists at the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center in order to deliver complete, reliable, up-to-date data sets for a number of early warning objectives, like trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring.

Early research focused on combining models of terrain-induced precipitation enhancement with interpolated station data. More recently, new resources of satellite observations like gridded satellite-based precipitation estimates from NASA and NOAA have been leveraged to build high resolution (0.05°) gridded precipitation climatologies. When applied to satellite-based precipitation fields, these improved climatologies can remove systematic bias—a key technique in the production of the 1981 to near-present CHIRPS data set. The creation of CHIRPS has supported drought monitoring efforts by the USAID Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET).

Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) is a 35+ year quasi-global rainfall data set. Spanning 50°S-50°N (and all longitudes) and ranging from 1981 to near-present, CHIRPS incorporates our in-house climatology, CHPclim, 0.05° resolution satellite imagery, and in-situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring.

**[WHO Health Facility database](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0142-2)**  
Hallo Jonathan, ich habe mir die Health Facilities in Tanzania nochmal genauer angeguckt. Für euren Fall würde ich empfehlen bei den MoH Daten zu bleiben. Die beiden anderen Quellen die ich mir noch angeguckt habe sind "The Global Healthsites Mapping Project" (healthsites.io) and the "Collated SSA facility database from WHO-KWTRP" (in dem Nature paper beschrieben, das ich dir letzte Woche geschickt habe). Die healthsites.io Daten scheinen keinen besonderen Qualitätssicherungsprozess zu durchlaufen und es sind viele Punkte z.B. als Krankenhaus eingetragen, die gar keine sind (soweit ich das durch ein Gegenchecken mit Google Maps/Streetview beurteilen kann). Die WHO-KWTRP Datenbank benutzt die Daten des MoH, allerdings konnte ich die Originaldaten noch nicht lokalisieren, da die Links im Paper mittlerweile veraltet sind. Ich kann auf die Daten zwar mittels dem R-package afrihealthsites zugreifen, allerdings sagen die Autoren des packages, dass sie die Daten einmal 2018/2019 als Excel Tabelle runtergeladen haben und seitdem nicht mehr aktualisiert haben. D.h. das package bietet die gleichen Daten an wie das MoH, aber halt auf dem Stand von 2018 oder 2019. Ich kann mir zwar nicht vorstellen, dass die WHO-KWTRP Daten einfach weg sind, aber finden konnte ich sie halt leider auch noch nicht. Es würde sich aber wahrscheinlich lohnen, da in das Zusammenstellen dieser Datenbank extrem viel Arbeit geflossen ist und sie eben die Health Facilities für ganz Sub-Sahara Afrika gebündelt drin hat. Mal sehen, vielleicht taucht sie ja noch auf.

 Supported indicators:  
- **accessibility**  
Accessibility is the ease with which larger cities can be reached from a certain location. This function allows to efficiently calculate accessibility statistics (i.e. travel time to nearby major cities)
for polygons. For each polygon, the desired statistic/s (mean, median or sd) is/are returned. 
- **biome**    
This function allows to efficiently retrieve the name of the biomes and compute the corresponding
area from Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (TEOW) - World Wildlife Fund (WWF) for polygons.
For each polygon, the name and area of the biomes (in hectare) is returned.   
- **chirpsprec**  
This functions allows to calculate precipitation statistics based on the CHIRPS rainfall estimates.
Corresponding to the time-frame of the analysis of the portfolio, monthly precipitation statistics are calculated. These include the total rainfall amount, rainfall anomaly against the 1981-2010 climate normal, and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) which is available for scales between 1 and 48 months. Th function needs the SPEI package to be installed.   
- **drought_indicator**  
This function allows to efficiently calculate the relative wetness in the shallow groundwater section with regard to the the 1948-2012 reference period. The values represent the wetness percentile a given area achieves at a given point in time in regard to the reference period. For each polygon, the desired statistic/s (mean, median or sd) is/are returned.  
- **elevation**  
This function allows to efficiently calculate elevation statistics for polygons. For each polygon, the desired statistic/s (mean, median or sd) is/are returned  
- **emissions**    
This functions allows to efficiently calculate emission statistics for areas of interest. For each year in the analysis timeframe, the forest losses from Hansen et al. (2013) are overlayed with the respective
emission layer from Harris et al. (2021) and area-wise emission statistics are calculated for each year. 
- **gmw**  
This function allows to efficiently calculate area of mangrove from Global Mangrove Watch - World
Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC) for polygons. For each polygon, the area of the mangrove (in hectare) for desired year is returned.  
- **landcover**  
The land cover data shows us how much of the region is covered by forests, rivers, wetlands, barren land, or urban infrastructure thus allowing the observation of land cover dynamics over a period of
time. This function allows to efficiently calculate area of different landcover classes for polygons.
For each polygon, the area of the classes in hectare(ha) is returned.  
- **popcount**  
WorldPop, which was initiated in 2013, offers easy access to spatial demographic datasets, claiming to use peer-reviewed and fully transparent methods to create global mosaics for the years 2000 to 2020. This function allows to efficiently calculate population count statistics (e.g. total number of population) for polygons. For each polygon, the desired statistic/s (min, max, sum, mean, median, sd or var) is/are returned.  
- **soilproperties**  
This indicator allows the extraction of zonal statistics for resource layers previously downloaded
from soilgrids, thus in total supporting the calculation of zonal statistics for 10 different soil prop-
erties at 6 different depths for a total of 4 different model outputs (stat). Zonal statistics will be
calculated for all soilgrid layers that have been previously made available vie get_resources().  
- **teow**    
This function allows to efficiently retrieve the name of the ecoregions and compute the corresponding area from Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (TEOW) - World Wildlife Fund (WWF) for poly-
gons. For each polygon, the name and area of the ecoregions (in hectare) is returned.  
- **treecover**  
This functions allows to efficiently calculate treecover statistics for polygons. For each year in the
analysis timeframe, the forest losses in preceeding and the current years are substracted from the
treecover in the year 2000 and actual treecover figures within the polygon are returned.   
- **treeloss**  
This functions allows to efficiently calculate the treecover and emissions indicators in a single func-
tion call together. Since most of the pre-processing operations for treecover and emissions are the
same, it is more efficient to calculate them in one run if users are actually interested in both statistics.
Otherwise users are advised to use the respective single indicator functions.  
- **tri**  
Terrain Ruggedness Index is a measurement developed by Riley, et al. (1999). The elevation differ-
ence between the center pixel and its eight immediate pixels are squared and then averaged and its
square root is taken to get the TRI value. This function allows to efficiently calculate terrain rugged-
ness index (tri) statistics for polygons. For each polygon, the desired statistic/s (mean, median or sd) is/are returned.  
- **wcprec**  
This function allows to efficiently calculate precipitation statistics from Worldclim for polygons.
For each polygon, the desired statistic/s (min, max, sum, mean, median, sd or var) is/are returned.
